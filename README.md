# EUSR-PCL
GAN-based image super-resolution using perceptual content losses (tensorflow implementation)

## Introduction
This repository include a implementation of GAN-based single image super-resolution using perceptual content losses (PCL), which considers both distortion- and perception-based quality of super-resolved images. In the PIRM Challenge on Perceptual Super Resolution at ECCV 2018, we won the 2nd place for Region 1. (Our team also won the 2nd place for Region 2 based on 4PP-EUSR [link to 4PP-EUSR](https://github.com/idearibosome/tf-perceptual-eusr){:target="_blank"})
