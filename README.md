# EUSR-PCL
GAN-based image super-resolution using perceptual content losses (tensorflow implementation)

## Introduction
This repository include a implementation of GAN-based single image super-resolution using perceptual content losses (PCL), which considers both distortion- and perception-based quality of super-resolved images. In the PIRM Challenge on Perceptual Super Resolution at ECCV 2018, we won the 2nd place for Region 1. (Our team also won the 2nd place for Region 2. Check this repository for this.)
